LDACS
=====

A link level simulator for the reverse link of the LDACS system
The simulator simulates Jakes spectrum rayleigh fading with 3 tap exponential PDP, and plots bit error rate vs. SNR curves. 

This was a project for the University, and will NOT be further developed by me. 
However, it is released as open source under GPL, and therefore feel free to fork and improve. 
Just remember to keep the result under GPL again.
